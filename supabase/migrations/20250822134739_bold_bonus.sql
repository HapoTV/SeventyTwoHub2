  # Fix Infinite Recursion in RLS Policies

  1. Problem
    - Infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "user_roles"
    - Circular dependency between user_roles and profiles table policies
    - Preventing business registration submissions

  2. Solution
    - Drop problematic recursive policies on user_roles table
    - Create simplified, non-recursive policies
    - Use direct auth.uid() checks instead of cross-table lookups
    - Ensure business registration can proceed without role dependencies

  3. Changes
    - Remove recursive policies that check user_roles from within user_roles policies
    - Simplify admin access using direct email domain checks
    - Allow system operations for user creation and role assignment
